## Name of the Technology/Tool

### The Problem and Solution

* Explain the problem that it solves.
* How does the technology solve the problem?
* What are the alternatives, and what are the pros and cons of the technology compared with alternatives?  (what makes it unique?)
* How it relates to concpts from 4111.  
* **NOTE: illustrating the relationship with concpts from this class IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT of this extra credit assignment**

Remember, the more detailed and thorough you contrast the technology with the topics in class the better.
We've discussed the relational model, constraints, SQL features, transactions, query execution and optimization, and recovery.   Pick a subset of topics to really dive deep and compare and contrast the similarities and differences between our discussion in class and the technology.

### Tutorial

**Note: Installation is less relevant than a tutorial highlighting the main concepts as they relate to 4111.**

#### Example

Construct and describe a compelling example for the technology that is motivated by one member's project 1 application.  The example and tutorial must be original.

#### Tutorial

Write a short tutorial on how to use the technology to solve the example.  It may help to link to a working example (github repo or colab notebook), or a Loom tutorial video.
