## Name of the Technology/Tool

### The Problem and Solution

- Explain the problem that it solves.
- How does the technology solve the problem?
- What are the alternatives, and what are the pros and cons of the technology compared with alternatives? (what makes it unique?)
- How it relates to concpts from 4111.
- **NOTE: illustrating the relationship with concpts from this class IS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT of this extra credit assignment**

#### SQL can do many things

- Simple select statement
- Simple mathematics: aggregation like count and avg
- Sophisticated math problem: graph problem as in project 2
- With recursive WITH: can even solve recursion problem
- One natural thing to think about: can it do even more things? like Linear Regression and machine learning?

#### Why using SQL to do ML (Pros):
- DBMS has a very good property called Integrity Constraint (IC), which make the data clean. As Prof. Wu mentioned in the very first lecture, people spent about 80 percent of the time doing data cleaning. Doing ML directly in DB can mitigate this issue.
- Instead of downloading and doing ML elsewhere, doing ML in DB is more efficient.
- Can avoid moving data around.
- Exploit advantages of query optimization procedure of DBMS.

Remember, the more detailed and thorough you contrast the technology with the topics in class the better.
We've discussed the relational model, constraints, SQL features, transactions, query execution and optimization, and recovery. Pick a subset of topics to really dive deep and compare and contrast the similarities and differences between our discussion in class and the technology.

### Tutorial

**Note: Installation is less relevant than a tutorial highlighting the main concepts as they relate to 4111.**

#### Example

Construct and describe a compelling example for the technology that is motivated by one member's project 1 application. The example and tutorial must be original.

#### Tutorial

Write a short tutorial on how to use the technology to solve the example. It may help to link to a working example (github repo or colab notebook), or a Loom tutorial video.
